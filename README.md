# SIMPLE_JARVIS
INITIATE THE JARVIS:
Although a fictional artificial intelligence, I have tried to make it real using Python.  



Face Train:
The motive is to create a dataset of your face(20 pics) on the basis of which detection of your face 
is done. It shows the Id,name,gender as per the details inside database named [FaceBase.db]


Face Detection:
This file detects the face  using the dataset of your pics.
Module Used:  Opencv for face detection
