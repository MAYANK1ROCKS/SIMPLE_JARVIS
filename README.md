# SIMPLE_JARVIS
INITIATE THE JARVIS:
Although a fictional artificial intelligence, I have tried to make it real using Python. 
Here are some of the static functionalities in the code.
It is going to be more dynamic if  machine learning  is used
in the code but for initiation, it's quite a worth.. 

Face Train:
The motive is to create a dataset of your face(20 pics) on the basis of which detection of your face 
is done. It shows the Id,name,gender as per the details inside database named [FaceBase.db]
Face Detection:
This file detects the face  using the dataset of your pics.
Module Used:
Opencv for face detection
